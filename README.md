This project was done as part of CSE 578 Data Visualization coursework at Arizona State University. We implemented the base system from scratch (mentioned in above research paper) and added Cluster Anaysis Component.
The system allows user driven data visualization using Scatter Plot Axes. The system works on three types of dataset: Cars, Pokemon and Spotify.
