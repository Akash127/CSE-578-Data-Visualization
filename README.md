# CSE-578-Data-Visualization

Switch to Development Branch for Latest Deployed Code.

## Design and Implementation

This project was done as part of CSE 578 Data Visualization coursework at Arizona State University. 
The system is the implementation of existing [research paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192671/) with addition of Cluster Analysis Component. The system allows user-driven data visualization by steering the axes of scatterplot according to his preferences.
The cluster analysis component allows user to select and save various generated clusters and compare them using beautiful and 
interactive visual graphs drawn using HighCharts library.
The system works on three types of dataset: Cars, Pokemon and Spotify.

The complete project is implemented using libraries and frameworks:
1. [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)
2. [High Charts](https://www.highcharts.com/)
3. [Booststrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
